 <h1>Stonehearth Alpha 15: Faster, Better, Stronger</h1>

Welcome to Stonehearth Alpha 15!

This release is all about better performance. We have made literally hundreds of under-the-hood improvements, both large and small, to give you a game that runs more smoothly, lags less, has fewer bugs, and is just all-around snappier than ever before.
You’ll find improvements in many aspects of the game, especially:
<ul>
    <li>Overall hearthling and settlement performance</li>
    <li>Building upgrades (with more improvements coming in future alphas)</li>
    <li>Inventory management</li>
    <li>Gameplay</li>
</ul>
All these taken together provide a game that’s faster, better, and more fun to play.

This is of course still an Alpha release; that means that though performance is improved greatly, some things may not perform exactly as expected. They're called bugs. Please report them in our forums at http://discourse.stonehearth.net

<h3>Big News! Starting with this Alpha, Stonehearth now has save compatibility with prior releases (in this case, Alpha 14). This is the first Alpha which retains save compatibility with a prior release; we hope to maintain this going forward (but no promises, okay?).</h3>

Here’s what’s new and notable in this release:
<h2>Moar performance? Moar hearthlings!</h2>
Territory and settlement management is much improved in Alpha 15. From enhanced pathfinding to better crafting to smarter enemy encounter placement, this release will allow you to build a bigger and better village than ever before, and run it smoothly.
<ul>
    <li>Increase max citizens to 50 in Gameplay settings menu (default setting remains at 20).</li>
    <li>Better support for larger settlements.</li>
    <li>Further progress on idle hearthlings.</li>
    <li>Optimize navgrid/sensor performance.</li>
    <li>Overhaul the encounter placement code so that it properly respects the player’s territory and avoids placing encounters in tunnels and water.</li>
    <li>Speed up camp placement 3-4x.</li>
    <li>New citizens avoid arriving in hostile areas.</li>
    <li>Move finding animals to the new placement code.</li>
    <li>Farmageddon! Numerous farming improvements including: ensure that farmers keep harvesting a farm as long as as they can find another crop nearby to harvest. This fixes some ping-ponging issues and odd harvesting behavior.</li>
    <li>Make it so if you have lost hearthlings past the initial 7, the net worth requirement for the next day will be lower.</li>
    <li>Fix bugs in hydrology code that could result in sucking up huge amounts of memory or CPU.</li>
    <li>Speed up physics code.</li>
    <li>Fix engine error when loading a game that was saved in xray mode.</li>
    <li>Add option in settings to show hearthling paths.</li>
    <li>Make sure enemies that are killed are removed from other populations’ global vision. Helps combat music not get stuck after killing all the enemies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building a better hearthling tomorrow.</h2>
Alpha 15 boasts numerous foundational improvements (a little building humor there) to design and construction. You know those multi-story buildings you tried to get your hearthlings to build? Now they will! Well, probably. This is, after all, only Part One of significant upgrades to building, to be continued in Alpha 16 and beyond. Still, in this release, you’ll be able to tackle more sophisticated structures that build more quickly.
<ul>
    <li>You can now use the slab tool to build interior and exterior stairs</li>
   <li>The wall and roof tools now apply themselves to the selected section, instead of to all places in horizontal building “floor.” This should help with cutting holes in multi-story buildings for stairs</li>
   <li>You can now use the slab tool to build overhangs, sheds, and porches that are adjacent to your houses</li>
   <li>You can now build columns close to other columns and slabs</li>
    <li>Building template names are now sorted alphabetically</li>
    <li>Creating a building template now takes a screenshot of the template for the UI</li>
    <li>Split flooring by wall tops, so that dependencies are much more spatially correct.</li>
    <li>If a floor isn't dependent on anything or supported by anything, look around or above for dependents.</li>
    <li>Provide support ladders for pieces of scaffolding that lack standability in their adjacent regions.</li>
    <li>Dig many foundations instead of one MASSIVE one; this improves performance significantly.</li>
    <li>Split really really big floors; see above.</li>
    <li>Simplify and generalize ladder height computation.</li>
    <li>Make sure we update the roof profile when computing its layout (and clipping existing building structures).</li>
    <li>Misc building micro-optimizations.</li>
    <li>Scaffolding now respects hearthling height.</li>
    <li>Better, more consistent scaffolding merging and re-use.</li>
    <li>Scaffolding can wait for a structure to complete before being placed on it.</li>
    <li>Fix not building scaffolding for overhanging roofs.</li>
    <li>Rebuild the templates with new floor tech.</li>
    <li>Fix some logging issues with building.</li>
<li>Various fixes for building dependency calculations</li>
<li>Performance improvements to "grow walls" code</li>
</ul>
<h2>We’re gonna clean up this town.</h2>
Let’s face it: your hearthlings are hoarders. They tend to amass lots and lots of stuff. And all that food, and raw materials, and crafted items, and loot can put a crimp in having a village run smoothly. TL;DR: too much stuff interferes with performance. That’s addressed in Alpha 15. There’s now an inventory cap (based on how many hearthlings a village has) -- so now you need to think more carefully about what items you really need, and not just grab whole lot of wood and stone. (Plus, we’ll be adding gameplay elements around inventory in future releases.) Remember, a tidy village is a happy village.
<ul>
    <li>Have inventory capacity be based on the max number of citizens you've ever reached, tunable per population.</li>
    <li>Add an inventory item count to the bottom of the inventory tab in town overview.</li>
    <li>Add a red warning if town inventory is full. Do not add items to town inventory if it is full.</li>
    <li>Show a bulletin when your town inventory is full.</li>
    <li>Bug fix for killing crafters and demoting crafters. Ingredients should end up on the floor.</li>
    <li>Add event in inventory for when entity container has changed to help diagnose missing inventory items.</li>
    <li>Create a crafter storage object for each crafter's backpack. This allows the inventory to know that even if the crafter inventory's object goes out of world, it is still in a storage.</li>
    <li>Add warning for when an item becomes no longer in the inventory.</li>
    <li>Micro-optimization to make restocking faster.</li>
    <li>Craft piles of wood, wheat, stone, and clay. For example, a log pile, crafted by the carpenter, converts 18 logs into a pile of logs. You can then harvest the pile of logs later. This helps people who want to have a large number of resources when inventory space is scarce.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Let’s play.</h2>
Even with all the attention on performance, we haven’t forgotten to tune the gameplay and content aspects of Stonehearth. You’ll find a ton of tweaks, bug fixes, and new stuff for your playing pleasure.
<h3>Introducing the Trader's Stall!</h3>
Got a few too many things in your inventory? Have a high level carpenter craft a trader's stall! Place the stall in the world and interact with it to call a trader to your town. When the trader arrives, click on them, or on the stall, to open a shop window. Profit! Though the trader will leave after a little while (places to go, people to see) you will be able to call a new trader after some time has passed in the game.
